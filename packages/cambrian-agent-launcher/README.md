# Cambrian SEI AI Agent (Enhanced Fork)

A chat interface for interacting with an AI assistant that can communicate with the Sei blockchain. 

**This is a customized fork of the original Cambrian agent-launcher.**

- Uses `sei-agent-kit-custom` (instead of the default) for deeper DeFi integration
- **Yei Finance integration**: supply, borrow, withdraw, repay, and health factor checking on Yei Finance on the Sei network
- **Dockerfile included** and a prebuilt image is available for easy deployment

---

## üê≥ Deploy with Docker Hub (Recommended)

You can deploy this agent instantly using the prebuilt Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key \
  -e SEI_PRIVATE_KEY=your_sei_private_key \
  -e RPC_URL=your_rpc_url \
  0xn1c0/cambrian-agent-launcher:latest
```

Or, using your own `.env` file:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env 0xn1c0/cambrian-agent-launcher:latest
```

---

## üÜï Enhanced Features

# Run with environment variables
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key \
  -e SEI_PRIVATE_KEY=your_sei_private_key \
  -e RPC_URL=your_rpc_url \
  cambrian-agent-launcher
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation (For Developers)

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CambrianAgents/agent-launcher
   cd agent-launcher
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   ./setup-env.sh
   ```
   This interactive script will guide you through setting up your:
   - OpenAI API key
   - Sei wallet private key
   - RPC URL (defaults to https://evm-rpc.sei-apis.com)

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

The chat interface provides a simple way to interact with the Cambrian AI Assistant. Simply type your question or request in the input field and press enter or click the send button. The AI will process your message and respond in real-time.

### Example Queries

**Basic Sei Network Operations:**
- "How can I interact with the Sei blockchain?"
- "How much sei do I own?"
- "Swap 5 sei for USDC."
- "Stake 3 sei."

**Yei Finance DeFi Operations:**
- "Supply 100 USDC to Yei Finance"
- "Borrow 50 USDC against my supplied collateral"
- "What's my health factor on Yei Finance?"
- "Withdraw 25 USDC from my supplied assets"
- "Repay 30 USDC of my borrowed amount"
- "Show me my current positions on Yei Finance"

## Scripts Overview

| Script | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `./run-agent.sh` | Complete setup and launch | First time setup, non-developers |
| `./setup-env.sh` | Environment variable setup only | Updating API keys, manual setup |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Node.js not found" error:**
- The install script will automatically install Node.js for you
- If manual installation is needed, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Make sure the scripts are executable: `chmod +x *.sh`

**Environment variables not working:**
- Re-run the environment setup: `./setup-env.sh`
- Check that your `.env` file exists and contains the required variables

**Port 3000 already in use:**
- Stop other applications using port 3000, or
- The app will automatically try the next available port

**Docker issues:**
- Ensure Docker is installed and running
- Check that ports are not already in use
- Verify environment variables are properly set
