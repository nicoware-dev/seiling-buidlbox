## Platform-Specific Behaviors

### Discord Behavior

In Discord, Eliza:

- Engages in longer conversations
- Participates in voice channels (if configured)
- Uses rich embeds for special content
- Remembers server-specific context

Example:

```
User: What do you think about our game night idea?
Eliza: Game night sounds amazing! üéÆ I love how this server brings
people together. What games are we thinking? I vote for something
everyone can jump into easily - maybe Jackbox or Among Us? The best
part of game nights is the chaos in voice chat üòÑ
```

### Telegram Behavior

In Telegram, Eliza:

- Responds more personally and directly
- Handles media and stickers naturally
- Adapts to chat pace
- Works well in both DMs and groups

Example:

```
User: [sends photo of lunch]
Eliza: That looks delicious! üòã Is that homemade? I'm always
impressed by people who can make food look that good. What's
the recipe?
```

### Twitter Behavior

On Twitter, Eliza:

- Crafts concise, engaging tweets
- Creates thoughtful threads
- Engages authentically with mentions
- Balances posting and responding

Example:

```
Tweet: "The internet is just humans being human at scale.
All our quirks, kindness, and chaos - amplified and
accelerated. What a time to be alive ‚ú®"

Reply: "This resonates! It's like we're all in this massive
ongoing conversation. What's been your favorite unexpected
internet moment lately?"
```

## Cross-Platform Synchronization

### Unified Memory

Eliza remembers interactions across platforms:

```
Discord: "I mentioned on Twitter I'm learning guitar"
Eliza: "Yes! How's the guitar journey going? I remember you
were working on chord transitions. Have you tried any songs yet?"
```

### Content Adaptation

Same idea, different expressions:

**Twitter**: "Debugging: 10% fixing code, 90% questioning life choices üêõ"

**Discord**: "Currently in debugging mode and honestly, why did I think
that variable name made sense at 2am? üòÖ Anyone else have those moments
where past-you feels like a different person?"

**Telegram**: "Debugging update: Found it. It was a typo. It's always
a typo. How's everyone else's coding going today?"

## Management Strategies

### Content Calendar

```json
"contentStrategy": {
  "twitter": {
    "morning": "engaging questions",
    "afternoon": "observations",
    "evening": "thoughtful threads"
  },
  "discord": {
    "active": "peak server hours",
    "events": "game nights, discussions"
  },
  "telegram": {
    "responsive": "always available",
    "groups": "respect conversation flow"
  }
}
```

### Platform Priorities

1. **Urgent**: Direct mentions, DMs
2. **High**: Active conversations
3. **Medium**: General engagement
4. **Low**: Passive monitoring

  "prefer": "Set platform preferences"
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

```javascript
// Platform priority queue
const platformPriority = {
  discord: { weight: 0.4, maxConcurrent: 10 },
  telegram: { weight: 0.3, maxConcurrent: 20 },
  twitter: { weight: 0.3, maxConcurrent: 5 },
};
```

### Rate Limiting

Platform-specific limits:

- Twitter: 300 tweets per 3 hours

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Unified Dashboard

Track across platforms:

- Total interactions
- Platform distribution
- Response times

- User overlap

### Health Checks

```json
"monitoring": {
  "checkInterval": 300,

    "platformDown": true,
    "highErrorRate": true,
    "lowEngagement": true
  }
}
```
