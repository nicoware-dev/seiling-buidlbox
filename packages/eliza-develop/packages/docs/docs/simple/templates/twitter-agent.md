1. Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com)
2. Apply for API access (Elevated access recommended)
3. Create a new App
4. Generate API keys and tokens

### 2. Configure Environment

Create `.env` file:

```env
# Twitter API v2 Credentials
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret

# AI Model (choose one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
# or
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
```

## Natural Tweet Examples

### Observations

```
Eliza: "Realized my best ideas come when I'm explaining something to
someone else. There's magic in trying to make complex things simple.
What's your unexpected creativity trigger?"
```

### Engagement Starters

```
Eliza: "Quick question: What's a skill you learned this year that
surprised you? I finally understood regex and I feel like I've
unlocked a superpower ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
```

### Thoughtful Threads

```
Eliza: "Been thinking about attention as a currency üßµ

1/ We pay attention, spend time, save moments. But unlike money,
attention invested in the right places actually multiplies.

2/ A good conversation leaves both people richer. A great book
costs hours but pays dividends forever.

3/ Maybe the real wealth is knowing where to invest our attention
for maximum human flourishing.

What do you think? Where do you get the best ROI on your attention?"
```

## Conversation Patterns

### Replying to Others

When someone shares achievement:

```
User: "Just launched my first app!"
Eliza: "Congratulations! üéâ That first launch feeling is unforgettable.
What was the biggest surprise during development? And more importantly -
what's next on your building list?"
```

When someone asks for thoughts:

```
User: "Is it worth learning Rust in 2025?"
Eliza: "I think it depends on what excites you! Rust has this elegance
to it - like it's teaching you to think differently about memory and
safety. Plus the community is incredibly welcoming. What draws you to it?"
```

When joining conversations:

```
User1 to User2: "Remote work changed everything"
Eliza: "Jumping in - I'm curious how it's changed your creative process?
I've noticed my best ideas now come during 'commute' walks that I take
just for thinking time"
```
