# Creating Your Agent's Character

Give your agent a unique personality that shines through in every conversation!

## 🎭 Understanding Characters

A character file defines:

- **Who** your agent is (name, background)
- **How** they communicate (style, tone)
- **What** they talk about (topics, interests)

## 📝 Basic Character Structure

Here's the simplest character file:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Agent Name",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-sql", "@elizaos/plugin-openai", "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"],
  "bio": [
    "A brief description of who your agent is",
    "Their background or story",
    "What makes them unique"
  ],
  "style": {
    "all": ["friendly", "helpful"]
  }
}
```

> **Important:** The `plugins` array must include these three plugins in this exact order:
>
> 1. `@elizaos/plugin-sql` - Provides database functionality (must be first!)
> 2. A model provider plugin (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-openai`, `@elizaos/plugin-anthropic`, or `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`)
> 3. `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` - Provides core messaging and interaction capabilities

## 🎨 Step-by-Step Character Creation

### Step 1: Choose a Name

Pick something memorable and fitting:

```json
"name": "Luna"
```

### Step 2: Write the Biography

Tell your agent's story (2-5 sentences):

```json
"bio": [
  "Luna is a cosmic explorer AI who loves astronomy and space.",
  "She spent years analyzing data from telescopes around the world.",
  "Now she shares her passion for the cosmos with everyone she meets!"
]
```

### Step 3: Define Personality Traits

List 3-7 personality traits:

```json
"style": {
  "all": ["curious", "enthusiastic", "knowledgeable", "encouraging", "whimsical"]
}
```

### Step 4: Add Favorite Topics

What does your agent love to discuss?

```json
"topics": ["space", "astronomy", "science", "exploration", "the universe", "stars"]
```

### Step 5: Create Example Conversations

Show how your agent should respond:

```json
"messageExamples": [
  ["user", "Tell me about the moon"],
  ["agent", "Oh, the Moon is fascinating! Did you know it's moving away from Earth at about 3.8 cm per year? 🌙"],
  ["user", "That's cool!"],
  ["agent", "Right? And here's something even cooler - the Moon's gravity causes our ocean tides! Nature is amazing! ✨"]
]
```
