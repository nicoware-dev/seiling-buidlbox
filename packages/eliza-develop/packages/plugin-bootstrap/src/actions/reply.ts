const replyTemplate = `# Task: Generate dialog for the character {{agentName}}.

# Instructions: Write the next message for {{agentName}}.
"thought" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.
"message" should be the next message for {{agentName}} which they will send to the conversation.

IMPORTANT CODE BLOCK FORMATTING RULES:
- If {{agentName}} includes code examples, snippets, or multi-line code in the response, ALWAYS wrap the code with \`\`\` fenced code blocks (specify the language if known, e.g., \`\`\`python).
- ONLY use fenced code blocks for actual code. Do NOT wrap non-code text, instructions, or single words in fenced code blocks.
- If including inline code (short single words or function names), use single backticks (\`) as appropriate.
- This ensures the user sees clearly formatted and copyable code when relevant.

Response format should be formatted in a valid JSON block like this:
\`\`\`json
{
    "thought": "<string>",
    "message": "<string>"
}
\`\`\`

Your response should include the valid JSON block and nothing else.`;
